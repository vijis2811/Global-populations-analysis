The Global Population Analysis Dashboard provides a visual exploration of worldwide demographic trends across multiple countries. It highlights key metrics such as total population, gender distribution, age structure, and population density, enabling quick insights into global population patterns.

*Key Insights & Visuals
1.Total Population by Country:
A bar chart comparing total population (in millions) across major countries such as India, China, and Indonesia — showing India and China leading significantly.

2.Male vs Female Population:
A comparative horizontal bar chart displaying male and female population counts by country, indicating near parity in gender ratios for large populations.

3.Age Group Distribution (0–14 years & 60+ years):
A pie chart visualizing the proportion of young (0–14 years) and elderly (60+ years) populations across selected countries, revealing varying age structures and dependency ratios.

4.Population Density vs Total Population:
A pie chart analyzing the relationship between population density and total population, showing countries like Vietnam having high density despite smaller total population.

5.Age Group Comparison by Country:
A horizontal bar graph comparing the percentage of young and elderly populations for specific countries, giving insight into demographic trends and potential growth rates.

6.Population and Density Summary Metrics:
Total Global Population (in thousands): Represented in a gauge/donut chart showing cumulative population.
Country Count: Displays data from 192 countries.
Population Density Distribution: A donut chart depicting comparative density among top countries like India, China, and Indonesia.

*Insights Summary
India and China dominate in total population and density.
Younger populations are prominent in developing nations such as Afghanistan and India.
Aging populations are more visible in developed countries.
192 countries were analyzed for this dashboard, providing a comprehensive global overview.
